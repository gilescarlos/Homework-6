// A positive integer greater than 1 is said to be prime if it has no divisors other than 1
// and itself. A positive integer greater than 1 is composite if it is not a prime. Write
// a program that asks the user to enter an integer greater than 1, then displays all of the
// prime numbers that are less than or equal to the number entered. The program should work
// as follows:
//      Once the user has entered a number, the program should populate a vector with all of
//          the integers from 2, up through the value entered.
//      The program should then use the STLâ€™s for_each function to step through the vector.
//          The for_each function should pass each element to a function object that displays the
//          element if it is a prime number.
